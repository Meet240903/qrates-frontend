            <h1>Rescue (5.30 A.M. on the Deck of the MPS Noorderzon)</h1>
            <p>In the early hours of a gloomy Sunday morning in Amsterdam – somewhere between 4 and 5 a.m. The night was a rush of music and ecstasy that took a deep toll on body and mind. On the back deck they stood – the guys from England or wherever – lost in the aftermath of the party. But then I appeared. Two sports cigarettes in my hands. A spark in the dark. And suddenly the night seemed to get a little lighter. Do you remember? Let these sounds take you back to that moment – where everything was quiet and alive at the same time.</p>
            <p>Dive in. Feel the vibe.</p>
