I also organized live acoustic sessions at my place and live shows in Paris with indie rock and pop musicians such as Ásgeir, Ryley Walker, etc. It was the coolest hobby. When I met with Romain and Rafaël at UC Berkeley in 2018, they had music projects and had struggled with getting their new tracks heard from press, radio, record labels. On my side, even though my Indeflagration blog was quite small, I was receiving over 100 requests per day from artists wanting to get their music featured!",

We called more than 200 musicians and music industry professionals during a whole month, Perron recalls.

Something comes out, and independent artists figure out how to make it work for them,” says Ariel Hyatt, a writer, teacher and digital marketer, whose own artist development and marketing strategy firm, Cyber PR, specializes in creating long-term plans and growth strategies specific to the online world. Twenty-five years a music industry veteran, Hyatt has a wealth of experience and understanding of how to survive as a musician in an over-saturated market dominated by Big Tech. “There are always these early adopter artists that are brilliant, and they figure out a way to make it work for them. Then, unfortunately, corporate money comes in and goes, ‘oh no, little artists, this is not for you’.” In order to help creatives achieve their goals before that happens, Hyatt has published several books on the subject. These best-selling titles show independent musicians with limited resources how to find their footing and their audience, building sustainable careers through the oft-daunting terrain of the internet. “I think it is a really hard thing for people to figure out,” she says via video chat from her home in New York. “I think social media has made it harder and compounded the issue, where now everything has to be a brand.”",

From “Building Your Brand” and “Creating Your Press Kit” to “Sending Media Pitches” and “What To Look For When Hiring A Publicist”, the book is the culmination of decades of experience. Hyatt is an early adopter of online marketing strategy and a champion and cheerleader for independent musicians. She has managed the careers of countless artists, navigating the volatile and ever-shifting social media landscape, from the halcyon days of the music blog, through the rise and fall of MySpace, into Facebook, Twitter, SoundCloud… the list goes on. “We're being forced to adapt and roll with the thing that's trendy,” Hyatt says, about her fundamental commitment to adapting to the frequent changes in online networking and mass communication. “It's about figuring out who your people are, how to connect with them, and how to keep those connections for a very long time.”",

No offense, but TikTok might not be the best platform for you. Not to take away from your talent or your art, and yes, people are getting discovered on TikTok, but is getting discovered necessary for sustaining yourself as a creative?’” Hyatt explains, saying that in the grand scheme of things, some approaches are more effective than others when it comes to the ‘long game’. “For me, it's about, ‘do we walk away with another fan?' Then it's worth doing because it's hard to walk away with a real fan when you do anything.”",
