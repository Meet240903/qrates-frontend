Since 2010 I have been working as DJ and producer. Chemical Modulation does not just want to serve one particular genre. Rather, it’s about using the versatility of electronic music. It’s not just about creating music for the dancefloor. It’s about the fun of creating music and expressing different states of mind. The songs are from calm and relaxed to aggressive and driving.", }

While not as groundbreaking as their later works like Flying Microtonal Banana or Polygondwanaland, it's part of the band's history. Despite being available as part of the band's compilation, Teenage Gizzard, The EP has seldom been reissued on its own. Stu says it's not canon, but that's what the bootlegger program is all about." },

Unfortunately, the sides on Anglesea are a hair too long for a 7 inch 45, and to cut a 7 inch at 33 1/3 RPM would mean the whole record would have suffered inner groove distortion. In order to preserve audio quality, I've upgraded to a 10 inch. Coupled with excellent remasters for vinyl by Angel Hair Audio (provided by Needlejuice Records), this is pressing will sound great." },

The new version was done with an AI upscaler, and I think you'll be pleased with the results. This will probably be the best this artwork has looked. Special thanks to Deaf Hammers for help designing the back cover and label designs, inspired by The Beatles' EP, Twist and Shout. The record itself will be on clear green vinyl, and the jacket will have a serial number on the back." },

Thanks for helping me will this record into existence." },

It is organically emotive and flows from start to finish with such ease that it's hard to press stop once you’ve started. Each track has its own unique identity and character yet they effortlessly melt into each other and gel as a whole cohesive project. We start with “Echoes Of The Past''. A guitar driven bass heavy lofi track that meanders through bass lines, guitar riffs, crisp drums and shimmering keys. The second track “Memories Of You” sticks in the same vein as the previous track but morphs the instrumentation slightly and creates a more etheric atmosphere with synth pads and pitched vocal shots. In contrast to these is the third helping, “How We Do It” is a heavily hip hop influenced track that is reminiscent of the 90’s era breaks, vocal cuts and horn stabs. This contrast continues throughout the Album as an almost call and response of styles. The overall tone of the album is consistent but the style keeps the listener guessing and intrigued." },

                        { content: 'But the story of Japanese reggae is not a linear one, and the music that is collected on Tokyo Riddim 1976-1985 captures the moment J-reggae entered the broader public consciousness, merging commercial city pop style with an infectious backbeat, that has drawn comparisons with the emergence of Lovers Rock in the UK.' },
                        { content: "Rather than look directly to Jamaica, many producers and artists in Japan were inspired instead by the more approachable sounds of The Police and UB40, their reggae fix arriving pre-filtered through the lens of new wave pop from the UK. Playful and groovy, these album deep cuts have been overlooked for too long." },
                        { content: "Among them are Miki Hirayama, the idol singer who borrowed the bassline from Bob Marley’s Natural Mystic on ‘Denshi Lengi’, Chew Kosaka, who headed to Hawaii to cut the Jimmy Cliff-inspired ‘Music’ and Marlene, the Philippine songstress whose cover of Roberta Flack’s ‘Hittin’ Me Wear It Hurts’ owed much to her producer’s obsession with Sly & Robbie’s Compass Point sound." },
                        { content: "Then there was Izumi “Mimi” Kobayashi, who enlisted the Babylon Warriors to perform on a dubbed-out version of her own track ‘Lazy Love’, the city pop-meets-new wave reggae sound of Miharu Koshi’s ‘Coffee Break’, Junko Yagami’s anti-apartheid deep cut ‘Johannesburg’ and Lily, whose ‘Tenki Ni Naare’ was produced by Ryuichi Sakamoto and closes out the compilation with a flourish." },

Previously only available in Japan, the tracks on this compilation are a testament to that curious alchemy." },
                        { content: "Tokyo Riddim 1976-1985 is released on vinyl and as a full album download (no streaming), featuring original artwork by Japanese Fukuoka-based artist Noncheleee, whose cover pays homage to the iconic dancehall album art of Wilfred Limonious." },

Rob had moved on from making music almost a decade ago, finding success in creating television series and writing for other shows. He had experienced some physical and emotional traumas that made him feel he would never make another record, in fact maybe never write another song. But, a few calls from friends that suggested it may be time to try again opened his mind that, perhaps, it was possible, and maybe even fun. A few short months later, and with the patient and gentle genius of friend and producer Rich Jacques, Meditation Drive-thru was born. It is the most real and honest of all of Rob's solo and bad recordings. “ Rob Giles is a Grammy-award winning singer-songwriter whose newest series “The F?ck” is in development at CBS studios.", },

The main purpose of the project was to process personal experiences and explore musical ideas that defied genre distinctions. The first demo titled ‘Bipolar’ was written that year, also in Kelowna. The demo was meant to be released as a full-length album as soon as possible, yet it took another 8 years of on and off work with various studios and session musicians to finally release it in its final form in 2020. Almost the entirety of the final album was recorded by ZB in a home-studio in Leiden, Netherlands. The sound was inspired strongly by second-wave Black Metal and DSBM as well as Neofolk from the early 00s. It is a very atmospheric and intimate sound, meant to reflect the personal lyrical themes.", },

The sound is more energetic, relentless and Hardcore-influenced than on the previous releases. The lyrical themes have shifted from introspection to philosophical and ethical arguments about human behavior, war and religion. The album is scheduled to be released on April 27th.", },
