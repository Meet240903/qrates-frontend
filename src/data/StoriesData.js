Or... maybe existence isn't the best word, because to exist means to stand out (etymology). Vedanta speaks to all ultimately being one thing (Brahman), or if you're Buddhist, Śūnyatā (emptiness). They are not the same thing—one identifies the Self with the ultimate reality of Brahman, and the other claims there is no Self by stating the inherent nature of things is empty. But they both describe the essence of reality in a way I resonate with, because I consider them two paths up the same mountain." },

Don't worry, it's not in the Bible! Shit gets too real in the gospel of Thomas, and sounds too much like Advaita Vedanta, or Buddhism for the modern Christian church to feel at all comfortable. Check out the video about it on the Let's Talk Religion YouTube channel." },
                        { content: "Christianity is one of the most diverse religions in existence. Since the first century A.D., it has been splitting into micro-sects. There were radically different interpretations of Jesus's teachings ever since the very beginning of the formation of the religion (which wasn't founded by Jesus, as he would've never have attempted to establish a religion). There have been many interpretations and translations of the original Biblical scriptures, and just as many edits. Learning from scholars who study the original Aramaic, Greek, etc., are better off communicating to you what certain sentiments really meant than your average modern-day pastor, at your average modern-day church. Different institutions wanted to push certain ideologies, and many of the ones who had more power were the ones who were able to perpetuate versions that were used to implement more control over regions and nations. Now, the church down the street is teaching mostly post-Reformation, post-Calvinistic theology. I am not going to try and objectively claim these are wrong or anything, but I don't necessarily vibe with them, their atonement theologies, and their worshipping of the name of Jesus, which he wouldn't have wanted either. Eastern Orthodox churches are more appealing to me, but even they can be pretty fundamentalist. I do think the Quakers have the right idea, as well as every single teacher/ preacher involved with the Center for Action and Contemplation, a Christian non-profit focusing on contemplation, mysticism, non-violence, compassion, nature, and self-transformation." },

Of course, the Bible itself is really helpful for that, as it contains a lot of Jewish mysticism, Greek mythology, paganism, and, of course, it has major accounts of Jesus's teachings, which are thoroughly important—I mean, it's called Christianity, after all. I think context is needed however, so I can't imagine the Bible being one's sole source of wisdom. I do not believe the it is infallible, and that every word is inspired by God. This is going to alienate me from much of this religion's followers, but so be it. Figures like Meister Eckhart, Thomas Merton, Richard Rohr, Hildegard von Bingen, Guigo II, John Of The Cross, Jim Finley, and Mirabai Star (an interfaith unitarian who educates people on women mystics like Teresa of Ávila) have had far, far more influence on me than any of our modern institutions, many of which I consider to be varying degrees of toxic, or at best just missing the point." },
                        { content: "In this mysticism God's nature is more akin to that of Brahman than Zeus. There is a lot of devotionality (kind of like, bhakti in Hinduism and Buddhism), but it is a dualistic concession to the ultimate non-dual nature of God. This is why Advaita is essential to my Christian leanings. Christian theology kinda just takes you so far. I think the Vedanta philosophy gets you the rest of the way." },

Mysticism definitely exists in his work. He quotes Jesus, Buddha, Meister Eckhart, Advaita philosophy, A Course In Miracles (often), and a lot more.

We think of (and treat these parts) as inner-entities that pawn all of these things, that are behind the wheel, informing us, influencing us, providing our foundations for living. Parts that make up the whole, like cells in our body, water molecules in the ocean, or seeming individuals in an ultimate reality of oneness.

Funnily enough, the joke and the label couldn’t be more accurate when describing the Canadian producer’s musical sensibilities. Growing up around his father’s vast collection of varying genres spanning the 70s and 80s, the beatmaker would start to familiarize himself with a range of soulful sounds that he would delve into much later. Fast forward to his preteens in 2003, when King Chino was introduced to the legendary beatmaker J Dilla by his school mate. Known for his seamless ability to create a groove and soul that most beats of that era weren’t channeling, the Detroit instrumental hip hop icon sits at the top of most producer’s Mount Rushmore." },

Later, the saxophone would come and stay in his life for a number of years before being overtaken by the time spent on guitar. In recent years, the multi-instrumentalist shares his recent desire to further sharpen his piano, drum, and bass skills to push his compositional ideas even further." },

That maybe spoke to us individually. Eric is out there touring as Luttrell, killing it in the progressive, trance, deep house universes. Andy was coding and working on his programming the whole time we were writing music and he’s now working for Google.

The last tour with The M Machine was 2017 and then I took a little bit of time off. That time ended up being full of writing and I did a little bit of travel in South America.

Some of the oldest wisdom we have in this human experience via Buddhism is still dealing with the same basic crutch of, ‘Ah, man, I care what people think’.”" },

Tangling with that and evoking the nuance of feeling it, regarding the human experience. I don't sit down and think, ‘I’ve got to write a thing that's gonna make somebody dance’. That's not what I do in my songs. I've done that for other people and that’s been really rewarding but my rule for myself is to write what's inspiring to me. And I find myself very much in thrall with those existential notions of life, and purpose, and spirit, and self, and how we relate to one another.”" },

The groovy saunter of rhythm guitar on “Hard For You” is interjected by a beefy electric solo and scat. “Brooklyn” is a beating pop and soul number marked by the call-and-response harmonies of a kind of gospel. The stripped-back production and raw honesty of the lyrics on Romance Without Finance express the seeds of the elegant simplicity that would come to define Katzman’s solo output into the future. Since then, there’s been the frank sadness of emotional pain for 2017’s Heartbreak Hits and the candid observations on humanity as a whole on last year’s Modern Johnny Sings: Songs In The Age Of Vibe. Each album is an effortless statement of Katzman’s perspective on love and life, and Romance Without Finance represents this approach at its most raw. “I'm a younger songwriter, and the songs sound younger to me, but some of them I still play today. I think it's just really close to the source. It's really honest and heartfelt,” Katzman explains. “I'm excited for some of my newer fans to hear this record, because I don't think as many of them know about this album, but I've been really pleased with the response.”" },

The feeling I have in my concerts, is that people know the songs and they want to sing the lyrics, and the lyrics are the thing that I work the most on.

Nothing changed around me or my community.” Japanese but raised in Singapore, Suzuki moved to London 17 years ago to “chase the dream”. He hustled in the city as a musician, a DJ and producer; a mixing engineer, a party organizer and promoter, before becoming disillusioned by the industry and the culture of competition it fostered. One spiritual awakening, and a huge personal epiphany later, Suzuki came to support himself through his Brilliant Corners sushi restaurant and venue, in East London and eventually started running the reissue focused record label Time Capsule." },

The speakers at Brilliant Corners are called Klipschorn. They were designed in 1947 for the theatre, and they never changed the design for 70 years. There's a physics to it. If you use those speakers, you use a certain type of amplifier because those are tuned to play the analogue sound, which is the scratching noise of the needle scratching the vinyl records. It's a physical vibration, going up and down. It's a completely different method to create the sound, compared to digital." },

But if you play that CD with a great CD player, which has got a great digital-to-analogue converter, and you have the amp, that is matching with the gain staging level and all these details, then a crappy analogue sound system obviously sounds shit compared to an incredible digital sound system." },

In order to play those sounds, you ought to play from the system that's made for it. If you're listening to 60s soul music on CD, it depends on the mastering of that particular remastering CD that you have. You might have some shitty bootleg CD, or you might have a deluxe Sony remaster series, that's amazing. There’s so much incredible music coming out after the 2000s, and they were never intended to be cut on a record." },

When she had an injury and needed to give up her dream, she became depressed, and went to Esalen Institute in Big Sur, which was the epicentre of ‘post-hippie’ culture. They were the first institute that experimented with Eastern philosophy and transpersonal psychology. It was the cutting edge of a spiritual journey at that time." },
                        { content: "Basically, through all these other spiritual gurus, Gabrielle invented this movement called 5Rhythms. The rest is history, but what we were really amused by was the music that she used. She had these live drummers in that class, and she would direct them to go through the five different emotions, as a different groove. They kind of started forming the musical session, from that drum into other instrumentation to develop their own kind of unique style of music. At that time—it was the late-70s, early 80s—there wasn't much of this kind of ambient or non-commercial type of music at that time. They really pioneered this rhythmic ambient music. Ambient music itself was probably being established around the same time by Brian Eno and all those people. It was really synchronized, but I guess it was a similar method that they used to express their music." },
                        { content: "They used an incredible line-up from the New York session scene. All those top backup bands and musicians were hired in the studio and Gabrielle would tell them, ‘okay, this is this kind of feeling’ and they had this basic drum beat recorded. But she would tell the musicians, ‘okay, you’re standing on top of a mountain, the wind is coming, and you scream.’ She did this kind of metaphorical direction and the musicians just had to fill in. They’d never been told what to play. They just had to jam on the material they had—all improvisation—so the music is just such a mixture of different styles of ‘spiritual music’, so to speak. They’re all kind of tuning into Gabrielle's spirituality and they all contribute their own unique sound. Some of them play very exotic instruments. The range of this style of music and its quality is just incredible. With the quality of those recordings, almost none of the music industry people were really aware of this whole catalogue these spiritual people were listening to as background." },

Originally self-released on CD in 2003, Kimmie Rhodes & Willie Nelson’s Picture in a Frame album features nine tracks of original songs and covers recorded by the duo with a small acoustic group one day at Nelson’s World Headquarters at his western town, Luck, Texas. “A bunch of us were hanging out at Luck, happy Willie was home for the holidays and Willie walked up to me and said, ‘As soon as Christmas is over, you want to make a record?’ And I said, ‘Sure!’” recalls Rhodes fondly." },

Miraflores effortlessly creates the album's atmosphere: graceful guitar lines intertwine lyrically, not devoid of a subtle Latin vibe and extra appealing thanks to the sober drum parts by Alfredo Bravo.

I started researching music production software, which is how I started with FL Studio. I saw Mujo情 a few times but really rarely, even though we lived close to each other in the same neighourhood.

You're given Aretha who is just a powerhouse. Truly the Queen of Soul: her prowess, her presence, her depth, her vocal capacity, everything. She's a force and she has been such a huge influence on me. To be able to capture a real moment in history, live! Aretha with a band, singing the classics and some not-so-classics but giving everything meaning and unmatched energy. It's something that will truly never get old. It feels like I own a piece of history." },

There are songs on here that have stuck with me for 15 years and then there are brand new songs that they never had previously released. It gave me a chance to reconnect with this album that I've loved for so long. It gave it like, deeper meaning, newer meaning. I want anyone who enjoys listening to my music, who feels something when they listen to my music and buys my vinyl, that they can put it on 20 years from now and still feel the same way they felt when they first listened to it." },

There's already such a vulnerability and rawness, and imperfectness in a live record. I think that the the artwork for that really reflected that. It looked kind of messy but still very evoking and really drew you in. There's just something so raw about it that feels human. This collection of songs that I've written and released for this project are the most intimate, vulnerable parts of me. They're not perfect and I wanted something that really reflected that in colour and in line work. I had my friend Rosalie write out everything, handwritten, so it just has that kind of look. I think that that really perfectly captures the essence of these songs." },
